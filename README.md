# Predicting Employee Performance
#### This project aimed to predict employee performance using regression analysis with a focus on model evaluation and feature selection

<br/>

The analysis is conducted in three parts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Principal Component Analysis conducted with aim of visualising and understanding features (principal components not used in modelling)
2. **Predictive Modelling** - Logistic Regression used to predict whether an employee exceeds expectations in perfromance evaluation or not
3. **Model Evaluation & Adjustment** - Cross-validation used to assess the variance of the model, and LASSO Regression used to lower model variance

<br/>

The **'Project Script'** hosts the code used to conduct this analysis, and the **'Final Report'** describes and discusses the result of the project.
